# AI Product Manager Nanodegree
This repository contains the projects submitted as a part of AI Product Manager Nanodegree program offered by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-product-manager-nanodegree--nd088).

**Overview**: The aim of this program is to help students learn to identify business cases that can benefit from AI technologies. A graduate of this program will be able to:  

- Decide to use an unsupervised, supervised, or deep learning model when approaching a specific problem. 
- Design a data annotation job to create a novel dataset.
- Build predictive models using automated machine learning tools. 
- Compare the performances of learned models using suitable metrics. 
- Prototype, test, and iterate on an AI product. 

**The skills of this program are demonstrated by building the following projects:**


# Project 1 : Create a Medical Image Annotation Job

Design a labeled dataset that distinguishes between x-ray images that indicate health or pneumonia in lungs using [Appen's Data Annotation Platform](https://appen.com/) and a Kaggle chest x-ray dataset.

# Project 2 : Build a model with [Google Cloud AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl)

Build four models using Google Cloud AutoML with four different variations on a medical imaging dataset. With the goal to observe how properties of the data impact the models' results.


# Project 3 : Create an AI Product Business Proposal

Develop a business proposal for an AI product. The project covers all topics discussed throughout the course. The project is described in terms of Business Goal, Success Metrics, Data Used, Model, Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and Post-MVP-Deployment.

In this project, an AI product was proposed, here called "InteliSocial", which is an AI-based tool that can be used for improving ad quality on social networks.
